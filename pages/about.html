        <h1>Hey everyone, I'm Jack!</h1>
        <p>I've always been interested in technology, from studying 
            IT in school, college and university, to building my own 
            computer in my teens. I've always grown up with IT and technology around me, constantly changing.</p>
        <p>I took both bootcamp courses (full stack software 
            development & cybersecurity) codenation had on offer, 
            after working as an animator as I wanted to pivot and 
            start a career in something new and to learn something 
            new.</p>
        <p>Having completed the courses I am completely hooked 
            and want to be given a chance to show people what I 
            have studied. </p>
        <p>One of the reasons I'm drawn to software development 
            is the opportunity to create innovative solutions to 
            complex problems.<br> 
            Whether it's developing new features, designing user 
            interfaces, or optimizing the performance of software 
            systems, software development offers a platform for 
            creativity and problem-solving.  </p>
        <p>One of my interests is Cyber Security.<br> In the realm of cybersecurity, I'm excited about the 
            opportunity to contribute to the development of robust security protocols and technologies. Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, and there's always a need for new strategies and tools to defend against emerging threats.<br>  
            I'm eager to work on developing and implementing security measures to protect against cyber attacks, as well as to contribute to the ongoing research and development of cybersecurity best practices. </p>
        <p>Aside from all the Software development and Cybersecurity interests, I am someone who loves to be creative. It's the part of my brain that does not chill out nor does it stop. One idea usually lead to 10 ideas, which leads to another 10 ideas or more, which I believe is a skill that allows me to think outside of the box and bring fresh perspective to everything I work on.</p>
